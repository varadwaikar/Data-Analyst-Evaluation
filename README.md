## **Problem Set 2 - Working with BigQuery**

Suppose you get a raw data of your website visitors and you are asked: 

1. Identify how many users came via a certain referrer url. 
2. Also, convert the ***visitStartTime*** property to IST

## **Problem Set 3 -  Case Study**

School Buddy is a new startup that helps students in identifying best schools as per their stream preferences. There are three streams in which students seek admission after passing their 10th board exams. Subjects for each of these streams are as follows:

Arts - Hindi, English, History, Geography and Civics

Science - Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Computer Science

Commerce - Hindi, English, Mathematics, Computer Science and Physical Education

School Buddy has collected marks scored by the same students for all the subjects for 3 consecutive years. Based on this information they have to find out below details:

1. Reward the top performer (student) of each school based on cumulative marks scored in last three years for all the subjects
2. Rank each student within their own school based on their total marks scored in the year 2020 and compare the marks of Rank 10 for each school by arranging them in descending order
3. Find out students with the highest improvement for each subject from 2019-21 combining all the schools together
4. 4. Identify best school for Arts, Science and Commerce streams based on marks scored by students in respective subjects for those streams in last three years
5. If the marks obtained for each subject can be categorised under 5 sections like below:
    
          <=20 - Very Poor
    
    >20 - <=40 - Poor
    
    >40 - <=60 - Average
    
    >60 - <=80 - Good
    
    >80 - <=100 - Very Good
    

Then calculate for each school how many students were in each category based on the avg. marks obtained each year

6)  Which is the best school for each year 2019, 2020 and 2021 based on highest no. of students in Good and Very Good category

7)  Which is the fastest-growing School in Bangalore (Overall and Streamwise)?

You are the Data Analyst who has to complete all the above analysis based on the attached files and prepare a PPT to present in front of the senior management of School Buddy.
